# pluggable

An experimental rust plugin system loosely based on ideas from COM (component object model).
Depends on proc-macros in pluggable-macros project (https://github.com/davidkern/pluggable-macros).

# Caution

Experimental! API in flux! Possibly unsound! Don't use this!

If that didn't scare you away, contribution welcome.
